## 🎉 What's Been Done

### ✅ Environment Setup
- Installed Supabase JavaScript client
- Created environment configuration files
- Set up local development environment

### ✅ Database Migration
- Created complete Supabase database schema with all necessary tables:
  - `users` - User profiles and authentication
  - `events` - Event management
  - `media_items` - Photo/video storage
  - `highlight_categories` - Event categories
  - `notifications` - System notifications
- Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Configured storage buckets for media files

### ✅ Code Migration
- Replaced Base44 SDK with Supabase client (`src/lib/supabase.js`)
- Updated all entity operations to use Supabase (`src/api/entities.js`)
- Maintained original API compatibility for seamless integration
- Added file upload functionality for media storage

### ✅ Development Server
- Development server is running at **http://localhost:5173**
- All dependencies installed and configured
- Ready for local development and testing

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Supabase Project (Required)
Since Docker wasn't available, you'll need a remote Supabase instance:

1. **Create Supabase Account:**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project

2. **Get Credentials:**
   - Go to Settings → API in your Supabase dashboard
   - Copy your Project URL and anon public key

3. **Update Environment:**
   - Edit `.env` file
   - Replace placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key_here
   ```

4. **Run Database Migration:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Copy and execute the SQL from `supabase/migrations/20240918000001_initial_schema.sql`

### 2. Configure Authentication (Optional)
- Go to Authentication → Providers in Supabase
- Enable Google OAuth provider
- Add your Google OAuth credentials

### 3. Start Developing
```bash
# The server is already running, but if you need to restart:
npm run dev

# Or use the PowerShell script:
.\start-app.ps1
```
